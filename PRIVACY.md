# Privacy Policy – NeckProtect

Effective date: **25 August 2025**

## Who we are
- MEV TOOLS INC (“we”, “us”, “our”) is the controller for the NeckProtect Android app (“App”).
- Contact: neckprotect@proton.me
- Postal address: [add address, optional]

## Summary
- We do not create accounts and we do not collect or store personal data on our servers.
- All posture detection runs on your device.
- If you choose to enable crash reporting, technical diagnostics may be sent to our crash analytics provider (Sentry) to help us fix problems. You can opt out at any time.

## What we do not collect
- We do not intentionally collect your name, email, contacts, photos, precise location, microphone, camera, or browsing content.
- We do not sell or rent your data. We do not use your data for advertising or tracking.

## Data we may process

1) Diagnostics and crash data (optional)
- What: crash stack traces, error messages, app version, device model, OS version, timestamps, and limited technical metadata. We configure the SDK not to send default personal identifiers (sendDefaultPii=false), and we do not intentionally include any text you type or content from other apps.
- Purpose: to diagnose, prevent, and fix bugs and stability issues.
- Lawful basis: our legitimate interests in maintaining and improving the App; where required, your consent. You can opt out at any time.
- Source: generated by your device.
- Sharing: sent to Sentry (Functional Software, Inc.) acting as our data processor. Sentry privacy policy: https://sentry.io/privacy/ DPA: https://sentry.io/legal/dpa/
- Retention: kept only as long as needed to investigate and fix issues; currently up to 90 days in our provider’s retention settings (we may delete earlier when no longer needed).

2) Support communications (if you contact us)
- What: your email address and the content of your message.
- Purpose: to respond and provide support.
- Lawful basis: our legitimate interests in responding to inquiries or your consent (where applicable).
- Retention: kept as long as necessary to handle your request and for limited record‑keeping, then deleted or anonymized.

## Permissions and on‑device processing
- Screen overlay: shows gentle on‑screen reminders. No data is collected.
- Brightness control: dims the screen as a cue. No data is collected.
- Notifications: lets the App run quietly in the background and pause easily. No data is collected.
- Sensors (e.g., accelerometer/gyroscope): used on‑device to estimate device angle for posture reminders. Sensor readings are processed in real time and not transmitted to us.
- Run on startup (optional): restarts the service after device reboot. No data is collected.
- Vibration (optional): haptic feedback for reminders. No data is collected.
- Internet access: used only for optional crash reporting and basic connectivity; no ads or tracking.

## Your choices and controls
- Crash reports: you can turn crash reporting on or off in the App settings at any time.
- You can also disable the App’s network access in your device settings or uninstall the App to stop all processing.
- Deletion of crash reports: email us with details (approximate crash time, device model, app version, and—if available—the Sentry event ID) so we can locate and delete relevant events.

## International data transfers
- If crash reporting is enabled, Sentry may process data on servers outside your country (e.g., the United States or the EU). Where required, appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses are in place; see Sentry’s DPA: https://sentry.io/legal/dpa/

## Security
- We use reasonable technical and organizational measures, including TLS for transport of crash reports, SDK settings to avoid sending personal identifiers, and scrubbing where feasible. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Children’s privacy
- The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we will delete it.

## Your rights
- Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict, or object to processing of your information, and to data portability. To exercise these rights, contact neckprotect@proton.me. You may also lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

## California privacy notice (CCPA/CPRA)
- Categories we may collect: Diagnostics (crash logs) if enabled; Identifiers you provide when you contact support (email address).
- We do not “sell” or “share” personal information as defined by the CCPA/CPRA, and we do not use personal information for targeted advertising.
- You can request access or deletion by contacting us. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights.

## Changes to this policy
- We may update this policy from time to time. We will post changes here and update the effective date. Material changes may also be communicated in‑app when practical.

## Notes for your Google Play Data safety form (not part of the policy, just guidance)
- If crash reporting is available: declare “Diagnostics – Crash logs” as collection, “Not shared with third parties” (Sentry is a processor), “Data is not required,” “Not linked to the user,” “Not used for advertising.” Retention: up to 90 days (or your actual setting). Provide an in‑app opt out.
- If you ship with crash reporting completely disabled: you can declare that you don’t collect data. If users can enable it later, you should still disclose the optional collection.
