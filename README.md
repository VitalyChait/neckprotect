## What is NeckProtect?  
NeckProtect is a simple app designed to help you avoid “tech neck”—the strain that comes from looking down at your phone for too long. It gives you gentle reminders right on your screen when it senses your posture could be healthier. These reminders might be a slight dimming of your screen or a light color overlay, encouraging you to lift your phone a little higher.  

---

## How it helps you  
- **Keeps track of your posture** while you use your phone.  
- **Sends gentle reminders** (like a small screen dim or overlay) to encourage healthier habits.  
- **Runs quietly in the background** while you use other apps.  
- **Easy to use**, with a guided setup and a quick switch to turn it on or off.

## Why it asks for permissions  
NeckProtect only asks for the permissions it truly needs to work well. For example:  
- **Screen overlay** – to show the gentle color reminder.  
- **Brightness control** – to let the app slightly dim the screen as a cue.  
- **Notifications** – so the app can run quietly in the background and let you pause it easily.  
- **Sensors** – to detect how you’re holding your phone.  
- **Restart support** – to keep posture protection on after your phone restarts (optional).  
- **Optional vibration** – a small buzz as a reminder if you choose.  
- **Internet (basic use only)** – used only for fixing errors and improving the app. No ads or tracking.  

---

## Your privacy  
- All posture detection happens **on your device**—nothing is sent elsewhere.  
- The app has **no advertising**.  
- Error reports may be sent (anonymously) to help improve reliability, but you can turn this off in your settings.

## Getting started  
1. Download and open NeckProtect.  
2. Follow the quick setup:  
   - Allow brightness control if you want screen dimming reminders.  
   - Allow overlay if you want gentle color cues.  
   - Allow notifications so it can run quietly in the background.  
3. Use the quick switch in your phone’s settings to turn posture reminders on or off.

## Tips for best results  
- Try to hold your phone closer to eye level. Even small improvements help.  
- Adjust the overlay brightness or dimming level so it feels comfortable.  
- If you use brightness reminders, turn off “Adaptive Brightness” for smoother feedback.
